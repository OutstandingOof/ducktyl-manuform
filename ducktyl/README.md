# Documentation for the Ducktyl-ManuForm

The documentation is split into a simple [build log] of the already generated default 5x6 model, a more [in-depht documentation] of the whole process and some notes on the configuration of the QMK-firmware used to power the keyboard.
While you should be able to build a fully functional Ducktyl-ManuForm by following the build log and using the default 5x6 model, I'd advise you to read the in-depht documentation if you want to customize anything, so you can better understand my approach and learn from my mistakes. 

## Simple build log 

What you will need: 

* 2 Pro Micros (Or a drop in replacement like the Elite C)
* 1 SSD1306 128x32 0,91" OLED Display (same as the [crkbd](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd))
* Mechanical Switches (Cherry profile) of your choice
* Keycaps of your choice
* 64 1N4148 Diodes
* Wire and isolated cables for wiring
* 2 TRRS jacks
* TRRS cable

Optional:

* EC11 rotary encoder + knob
* Kailh hot swap sockets CPG151101S11

And the obvious part: The 3D printed cases.
